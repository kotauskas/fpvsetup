//! The "portal-like" mode will perform the necessary trigonometry and output the configuration for the camera which will allow the screen to appear as if it is a portal into the rendered 3D world, improving perception of depth and realism.
//!
//! The "focused" mode will output an FOV for the camera which will represent an accurate scale of objects at a given distance in the 3D world from the camera.
